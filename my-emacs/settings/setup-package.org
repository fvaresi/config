* Emacs packages

  It seems marmalade repo is not required anymore for most packages, so I stick with melpa. Also added org repo to install org-plus-contrib.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)

  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
  #+END_SRC

  One problem of melpa repository is that it receives updates as soon as their published, so it's up to the maintainer to keep the package stable. The upside of this is that bugs are detected and fixed early. The downside is that you may have unexpected bugs.

  AFAIK, the only way to avoid this is to use [[http://stable.melpa.org][melpa stable]]. You can then pin some packages to this repo like this:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :eval never
    ;; (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
    ;; (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages '(cider . "melpa-stable") t)
  #+END_SRC

  I keep a list of the packages I've installed so that a fresh install requires just to eval =gimme-my-packages=. Make sure you re-eval it after adding a package.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (package-initialize)

    (defun gimme-my-packages ()
      (interactive)

  [[https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox/][Paradox]] is a great interface for package managing.
