* Appearance   
  Set the default font, favorite theme and frame title as early as possible.

  I've also tried =Source Code Pro-10= and =M+ 1mn-11= but decided to stick with =DejaVu Sans Mono-10=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "DejaVu Sans Mono-10")
  (setq frame-title-format "%f")
  (load-theme 'sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties t)

  [[https://github.com/Malabarba/smart-mode-line/][Malabarba's Smart Mode Line]] keeps a clean mode-line.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'smart-mode-line)
  (sml/setup)
  (sml/apply-theme 'respectful)	      
  #+END_SRC

  This package uses [[https://github.com/Malabarba/rich-minority][rich-minority]], which allows me to exclude some modes I don't really need to see. If I need to check with minor modes are activated, I just have to hover over the number in the modes section.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'rm-excluded-modes " yas")
    (add-to-list 'rm-excluded-modes " company")
    (add-to-list 'rm-excluded-modes " Undo-Tree")
    (add-to-list 'rm-excluded-modes " FlyC")
    (add-to-list 'rm-excluded-modes " Guide")
    (add-to-list 'rm-excluded-modes " Helm")
